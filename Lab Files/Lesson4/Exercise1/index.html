<h1>My first web page</h1>

<h2>What's it all about?</h2>
<p>This is a webpage to demonstrate some of the most useful <em>elements</em> (also known as <em>tags</em>) that are available in HTML. You can use it as a starting point for adding in HTML of your own. You can also use it to practise using CSS to add styling and JavaScript to add functionality.</p>

<h2>Some of the things you should know about HTML</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There is a always a head and there is always a body
        <ol>
            <li>The head is used to add "meta" infomation</li>
			<li>The head can contain links to separate CSS and JavaScript files</li>
            <li>The body is where you put all the HTML elements that are to be displayed on the page</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Elements have two parts - an open and a close</li>
	<li>You can use F12 (Developer Tools) to inspect the HTML in this page</li>
</ul>

<h3>Divs are used a lot for styling</h3>
<div class="important">Really important information</div>
<div>should</div>
<div>be</div>
<div class="important" id="mostimportant">higlighted so you notice it!!!</div>


<h3>Tables are also very useful. Here is an example without any useful data in it</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
        <td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
        <td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
        <td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
        <td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 3, cell 1</td>
        <td>Row 3, cell 2</td>
        <td>Row 3, cell 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 4, cell 1</td>
        <td>Row 4, cell 2</td>
        <td>Row 4, cell 3</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Now let's see how we can call some JavaScript by clicking a button</h3>
<label>Click the button to change the color of the "most important" div</label>
<button onclick="pickNewColour()">Change the colour</button>

</body>
